:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

## Client package releases


### mittwald PHP SDK Release v2.1.86

The latest release of the mittwald PHP SDK, version [v2.1.86](https://github.com/mittwald/api-client-php/releases/tag/v2.1.86), introduces several new features and improvements:

#### Features
- **Database User Status Enum**: A new enum `DatabaseUserStatus` has been introduced to represent various states of a database user, including `pending`, `ready`, `error`, `terminating`, and `disabled`.
- **MySQL User Enhancements**: The `MySqlUser` class now includes a `status` field and a `statusSetAt` timestamp, enabling tracking of the current operational status of a MySQL user.

#### Improvements
- The `ListArticlesRequest` class has been refactored to remove the default limit value, making the limit a nullable field. A new method `withoutLimit` has been added to facilitate requests without a limit.

#### Deprecations
- The `title` field and its corresponding methods in the `Profile` class have been marked as deprecated and should not be used in future developments.
