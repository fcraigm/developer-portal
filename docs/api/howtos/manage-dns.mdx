:::note

In the following examples, substitute `PROJECT_ID` with your actual project ID. Please note that this needs to be the
**full id** (formatted as a UUID), and **not** the short ID (formatted as `p-XXXXX`).

## Setting a A/AAAA record for a domain or subdomain

To modify the A or AAAA records of an existing domain or subdomain, you first need to obtain its DNS zone id. For this,
list the project's DNS zones by using the <OperationLink operation="dns-list-dns-zones" /> endpoint. In the following
examples, this zone ID will be referred to as `ZONE_ID`.

You can then modify your A and AAAA records using the <OperationLink operation="dns-update-record-set" /> operation.
Note that this operation is used for modifying _both_ A and AAAA records (even though the `recordSet` path parameter
should always be set to `"a"`):

<OperationExample
  operation="dns-update-record-set"
  pathParameters={{ recordSet: "a", dnsZoneId: "ZONE_ID" }}
  example={{
    a: ["203.0.113.1", "203.0.113.2"],
    aaaa: ["2001:0DB8::1", "2001:0DB8::2"],
    settings: { ttl: { auto: true } },
  }}
/>

## Setting a CNAME record for a subdomain

### Optional: Creating a subdomain first

If the subdomain does not already exist, you need to create it first:

<OperationExample
  operation="ingress-create-ingress"
  example={{
    hostname: "subdomain.domain.example",
    paths: [{ path: "/", target: { useDefaultPage: true } }],
    projectId: "PROJECT_ID",
  }}
/>

In this case, the `paths` property is largely irrelevant (since you'll be setting a custom CNAME record anyway), but
it still is required by the API. Use the `useDefaultPage` target from the example if you do not want to explicitly
define a domain target.

### Setting the CNAME record

When the subdomain exists, you first need to obtain its DNS zone id. For this, list the project's DNS zones by
using the <OperationLink operation="dns-list-dns-zones" /> endpoint.

Given the zone ID (referenced as `ZONE_ID` in subsequent examples), you can then set or modify the CNAME record:

<OperationExample
  operation="dns-update-record-set"
  pathParameters={{ recordSet: "cname", dnsZoneId: "ZONE_ID" }}
  example={{
    fqdn: "your-cname-target.example",
    settings: { ttl: { auto: true } },
  }}
/>

## Resetting custom A/AAAA/MX records

Typically, A, AAAA and MX records are managed by the mittwald platform, which you can override by setting custom records
using the methods explained above. If you want to reset a record set to being managed by the mittwald platform, use
the <OperationLink operation="dns-set-record-set-managed" /> operation.

<OperationExample
  operation="dns-set-record-set-managed"
  pathParameters={{ recordSet: "a", dnsZoneId: "ZONE_ID" }}
  example={{}}
/>
