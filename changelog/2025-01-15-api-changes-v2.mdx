### mittwald PHP SDK Release v2.1.92

The latest release of the mittwald PHP SDK, version 2.1.92, introduces significant changes by removing certain components related to marketplace functionalities.

- **Removed OptionalExtension Class**: This class, which was responsible for handling various marketplace-related functionalities such as validation and management of properties like `backendComponents`, `blocked`, and `context`, has been completely removed.
- **Removed OptionalExtensionState Enum**: The enum that defined possible states (`enabled`, `blocked`, `disabled`) for an optional extension in the marketplace has also been eliminated.

These removals aim to streamline the marketplace schema, simplify the model structure, and potentially improve code maintainability.
