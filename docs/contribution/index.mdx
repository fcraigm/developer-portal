## Introduction to the Contribution Concept

**Extensions are the ideal way to extend the functionality of the mStudio.**

An extension is a web application managed by a contributor and provided to the mStudio users.
An authorized user can then install that extension.

The content, or rather the functionality, of the extension should provide value for the mStudio user with managing, creating, and editing their web projects.
It should achieve this by extending the functionality of the mStudio.

From a technical perspective, an extension is an application separate from and independent of the mStudio and integrates with the mStudio via REST APIs.
An extension has to provide a publicly available backend.
If, for example, instances of the extension are created or deleted, the mStudio notifies the extension via webhooks to its backend.
It may also provide a frontend if that makes sense for the extension's use case.

## Structure of this documentation

This documentation will guide you while learning about the fundamental concepts of extension development.
Combined with your development experience and your idea for an extension, this documentation should enable you to develop your extension and release it for mStudio users.

This documentation also describes fundamental organizational processes in addition to technical content.
You will find information about the platform where mittwald and contributors exchange information, the support path for the users of your extension, and the billing of your extension.

In the [Glossary](glossary), you find definitions of various terms.

The section [Overview](../category/overview) conveys fundamental knowledge about extensions.

The section [How-To](../category/how-to) answers frequently asked questions.

The section [Reference](../category/reference) describes technical concepts in depth.
It includes documentation of schemas, templates, tips for development, and explanations.

The opportunity for external contributors to develop extensions is new for mittwald.
We are actively working on this concept, and this documentation is therefore updated regularly.
If you miss something in the documentation, please use the button in the top right corner to contact us via GitHub.
We are grateful for any feedback!
