## Usage

### Notes on Data Protection

:::note

Ensuring data protection-compliant usage is the responsibility of the applying party. This includes consent, purpose limitation, and the design of the AI functionality in the specific use case.

:::

The models provided by mittwald’s AI Hosting are tailored for data-sensitive applications used by agencies or their end customers. All models run on mittwald's infrastructure and are integrated into our existing hosting environment. If mittwald’s AI Hosting is accessed through a mittwald hosting product, all data processing remains entirely within our infrastructure.

All communications with the offered models are encrypted during transmission according to the state of the art (https).

The models provided are not self-learning; each model remains in the state in which it was published. Queries or submitted data do not influence the model, nor are they aggregated, stored, or used to improve the models.

Our models operate in a `stateless` manner, meaning no content-related information from submitted inputs, outputs, or prompts is stored or processed for other purposes. However, for billing, performance analysis, and system stability improvements, we retain log files and metadata of submitted requests. These include IP address, API key used, timestamp of the request, and number of tokens transmitted—but not their content.

Our product is designed for GDPR-compliant usage, as no data is transferred to third parties and no content data is stored. However, we point out that GDPR and legal compliance ultimately depend on the specific use case. For example, the models in mittwald’s AI Hosting can be used to build your own AI applications. In these cases, it may be necessary to obtain user consent if personal data is processed, or the algorithm generated with our product may not comply with legal requirements such as the EU AI Act. We have no influence on this and refer to the Terms of Use.

If user applications store model-generated content or embeddings, this storage or processing occurs within the services and hosting products used by the application—but not within the scope of mittwald’s AI Hosting. For example, Open WebUI can run in mittwald’s container hosting. The chat history or uploaded documents are stored within the containers in the hosting infrastructure, not in the models themselves.

### Terms of Use

In addition to the General Terms and Conditions, the following terms apply to the use of mittwald’s AI Hosting. These may be updated in line with changes in legal frameworks, technical circumstances, or security requirements.

#### Responsibility for Use

The user is solely responsible for the lawful use of the service. It must be ensured that all queries, applications, and further use of the generated content comply with applicable law. This includes in particular:

- Data protection requirements (e.g. GDPR),
- Copyright, competition law, and other intellectual property rights,
- Requirements of the EU AI Act, especially in high-risk or regulated applications.

#### Prohibited Uses

Use of the service is prohibited if it is used to:

- Generate or disseminate content that violates applicable law (e.g. glorification of violence, hate speech, disinformation, malware),
- Engage in practices prohibited under the EU AI Act (e.g. manipulative systems, social scoring, biometric mass surveillance),
- Bypass service security mechanisms or exploit systematic vulnerabilities.

#### Use in High-Risk Applications

Certain application scenarios fall under the “high-risk” category as defined by the EU AI Act (e.g. credit scoring, applicant evaluation, critical infrastructure). These require additional legal obligations, such as:

- Risk assessment and documentation,
- Model and data validation,
- Human oversight measures,
- Conformity assessment.

The service must not be used in such scenarios without fully meeting these requirements in a legally secure way.

#### Operation, Fair Use, and Technical Notes

- Usage must remain within the stated capacity and rate limits.
- Access must not impair system stability through automated or excessive requests.
- API keys must be kept confidential.
- Model versions may change technically or in content; corresponding tests in integrations must be planned accordingly.

#### Disclaimer

The service is provided "as is" without any warranty. No responsibility is taken for the content or effects of the generated outputs. Legal review of the use, exploitation, or distribution is the user's responsibility. Any liability for direct or indirect damages is excluded.

#### Model Licenses

The provided models may be subject to additional licenses (e.g. Apache 2.0, MIT). Their respective license and usage terms must be observed and are referenced in the model documentation.

### Lifecycle

As with many other products, the models offered are subject to a lifecycle. Since the models are evolving, we may upgrade them to newer versions or replace them entirely. Older versions will then no longer be offered or accessible. As a result, newer models may behave differently and may also have different names. This is outside our control.
