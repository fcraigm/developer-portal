title: How to Support the Users of Your Extension
---

The users of your extension will inevitably have questions or suggestions.
Currently, you can specify a support e-mail address for your extension where your customers can send their questions.

In the future, we will provide a support system for you.
The user sends their question via the already-known ticket system in the mStudio.
We filter the tickets concerning billing automatically and answer them for you.
You will receive all other questions as tickets.
You can process these tickets via the mStudio ticket system.
Or if you would rather use your ticket system, you can integrate these tickets via an API.
