:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

## Summary


- The response property `/items/assets/items/fileName` became optional for the status '200' in the following operations: 
  - GET `/v2/contributors/{contributorId}/extensions` (List Extensions of own contributor)
  - GET `/v2/extensions` (List Extensions)

## Client package releases


### Release Summary: mittwald PHP SDK v2.1.117

The mittwald PHP SDK has released version v2.1.117, which introduces several changes aimed at improving the flexibility and maintainability of the SDK. 

#### Key Updates:
- **Deprecated Features**: 
  - The `fileName` property and its associated method `getFileName()` have been deprecated. The method will now return `null` if the filename is not set.
  - A new method `withoutFileName()` has been added to manage the removal of the `fileName` attribute explicitly.

- **Class Structure Changes**:
  - The `fileName` attribute is no longer a required parameter in the constructor.
  - The class now treats `fileName` as a nullable attribute, setting it only when provided.

These updates are designed to enhance the flexibility of the `ExtensionAsset` class and prepare for the future removal of deprecated features. The introduction of nullable types and explicit removal methods contributes to a cleaner and more extensible class design.
