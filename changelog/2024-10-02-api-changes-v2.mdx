:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

## Client package releases


### mittwald PHP SDK v2.1.69 Release

The mittwald PHP SDK has been updated to version 2.1.69. This release includes several important changes to the `ListAppinstallationsRequest` class, specifically regarding the handling of the `page` parameter:

- **Removals**: The `page` property was temporarily removed from the schema and various methods.
- **Re-additions**: The `page` property has been reintroduced with correct validations in the relevant methods (`withPage`, `getPage`, and serialization).
- The `withPage` method now correctly allows setting a `page` number with validations.
- The `withLimit` method was corrected to set the `limit` property instead of `page`, with the logic moved to the `withPage` method.
- Redundant logic for setting `page` in class methods was corrected to ensure the integrity of the request model.

These changes enhance the API request capabilities, ensuring robust support for pagination through the `page` and `limit` properties, leading to improved efficiency in querying installed applications.
