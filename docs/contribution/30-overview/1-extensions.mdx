## What is an extension?

From a domain perspective, an extension is an expansion of the mStudio providing additional functionality.
It is [made available](../../how-to/create-extension) in the mStudio and can be added to an [extension context](../../glossary/#extension-context) by potential users.
When a user adds an extension to an extension context (for example, a project or organization), the mStudio creates an [extension instance](../../glossary#extension-instance).
Therefore, the extension describes an expansion that can be added to an extension context.
The extension instance is a concrete manifestation of an extension in an extension context.

From a technical perspective, an extension is a separate and independent application that communicates with the mStudio via REST APIs.
An extension must provide a public backend and may provide a frontend if it makes sense for its usage.
If extension instances are created or deleted, for example, the mStudio notifies the extension backend via a [lifecycle webhook](../concepts/lifecycle-webhooks).

The extensions also provide various [authentication and authorization strategies](../concepts/authentication) to perform authenticated [domain actions](../../glossary#domain-action) in the mStudio.
These domain actions can occur in the name of the mStudio user using the extension or in the name of the extension itself.

## Which information does an extension consist of?

An extension consists of various pieces of information described in detail in the [extension reference](../../reference/extensions).
The following is an overview.

### Name and Descriptions

An extension has four different description fields.

The first elements visible to the user are the **Name** and the **SubTitle**.
The **Name** can be creative and engaging â€“ it does not have to be descriptive.
The **SubTitle** provides a brief and concise way to highlight the main selling point of the extension.

For a slightly more detailed explanation, the **Description** can be used.
Additionally, there is a **Detailed Description**, which contains even more information and allows formatting.
Here, you can explain features, provide instructions, share links for further reading, include a changelog, and much more.

### State

The **state** of an extension defines whether the extension should be visible or usable in the mStudio.
This includes, for example, whether it is generally active, displayed in the marketplace, and can be added to an extension context.

### Tags

Tags provide a way to categorize extensions.
The mStudio uses them to group extensions based on their use case.
You should ensure the tags are meaningful and allow an unambiguous mapping to the extension features.
You also should ensure the tags match terms potential users might use to search for the extension.
A category with only one extension does not provide value when searching for extensions.
It reduces the ability to find and compare extensions.

### Support

It is the responsibility of the contributor to support the users of their extensions.
Therefore, the extension users need information about how to request support.
You have to provide at least an E-Mail address where users can contact you.

### Scopes

An extension needs permissions to access the REST API of the mStudio and execute **domain actions**.
These have to be accepted by the user when installing the extension.

These permissions are defined by [**scopes**](../concepts/scopes).
The extension definition contains a list of scopes describing the extensions permissions.

### Extension Context

Users can add an extension either to a project or an organization.
As a contributor, you must decide which extension context makes sense for your extension.
This decision depends on multiple factors, such as the target audience, use case, or business model.

### Lifecycle Webhook Endpoints

An extension must define which URLs should be used by the mStudio to send lifecycle webhooks.
The mStudio uses these webhooks to notify the extension of the existence and state of its extension instances.
You can configure a separate webhook endpoint for each lifecycle event.
For more information, see [lifecycle webhook concept](../concepts/lifecycle-webhooks).

### External Frontend

Optionally, an extension may define an external frontend that functions as an entry point to the extension.
You configure the external frontend as a URL, for which you may use templating.
For more information, see [templating of configuration values](../concepts/templating) and [lifecycle webhook concept](../concepts/lifecycle-webhooks).

## Lifecycle of an Extension

### Registration and Verification

<OperationLink operation="extension-register-extension" />

After registering an Extension, verification can be requested.
To initiate this process, the following information must be provided:

- A unique name for the Extension.
- Defined scopes and context.
- Support contact details.
- If the Extension is not free, webhookUrls must also be specified.

Contributors have the option to abort the verification process at any time.\
Once submitted, the Extension will be reviewed and verified by mittwald.
If no feedback is provided and the Extension meets all requirements, it can be published.
Only the Contributor has the authority to publish an Extension.

### After Publication

Once published, an Extension can be withdrawn by the Contributor.
This action prevents new Extension Instances from being created and disables existing Extenion Instances, which is useful for maintenance.
The extension can be republished later without requiring a new verification.

### Modifying an Extension

<OperationLink operation="extension-patch-extension" />

Changes to scopes or webhookUrls require verification by mittwald.
Once accepted, these changes take effect immediately.

- The Context of an Extension can only be modified before the initial verification request.
- During development, the Context can be changed freely, but this will remove all existing Extension Instances.

### Adding Extension Instances to a Context

To add an Extension Instance to a Context, the context must first be set.

- Before publication, only the contributor can create Extension Instances within their own organization or projects.
- After publication, anyone can create Extension Instances.

### Deleting an Extension

To gracefully remove an extension, a deprecation process should be defined. This process includes:

- Specifying a shutdown date.
- Defining a successor, if applicable.

Extensions are deleted asynchronously, as all associated instances must be removed beforehand.

## Versioning of Extensions

The mStudio does not provide a concept for the versioning of extensions.
Extensions are separate applications the corresponding contributor is responsible for, integrated with the mStudio only via the public REST API.
Therefore, mittwald can not reliably manage the versioning and stability of versions of extensions.

The use case of an extension may require providing functionality in different versions.
You can implement this versioning independently of the mStudio.
You are responsible for versioning your extensions and may introduce individual rules and conventions.

If the extension provides an API used by external applications, you should ensure its stability.
To this end, you may use commonplace conventions and best practices for API versioning.
