title: How to Become a Contributor
---

Anyone who wants to can become a contributor in principle.
However, there are two organizational things you need to do before you can get started:

## Creating an Organization in the mStudio

To get started as a contributor and submit extensions to the mStudio, you need a mStudio user and organization.
You will contribute in the name of this organization.
If you don't yet have a mStudio user, you can [register here](https://studio.mittwald.de).

After you log into the mStudio, click on "Organisationen" in the menu bar on the left or [visit this link](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/organizations) and then click the button "Organisation anlegen" in the top right corner.
At first, you only have to specify the name of your organization.
You can add all other information to the organization later.

## Listing as a Contributor

Personal support is important to us.
Please send us an email at contributorwerden@mittwald.de.
We will call you back, answer potential questions, and finally list you as a contributor.
Very uncomplicated and with a direct line to personal contacts.
