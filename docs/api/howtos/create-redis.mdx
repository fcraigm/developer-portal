This article describes how to create a Redis database via the API.

## Prerequisites

To create a Redis database, you will need to have access to a project. Refer to the [guide "create a project"](../create-project) for this. You will need the **project ID** for the subsequent operations.

## List available Redis versions

Set a request to the <OperationLink operation="database-list-redis-versions" /> endpoint to get a list of available Redis versions.

## Creating a Redis database

To create a Redis database, send a request to the <OperationLink operation="database-create-redis-database" /> endpoint. The request body must contain a JSON object with the following properties:

- `description` should contain a human-readable description of the database. This is a required value.
- `version` should contain the version of the database. This is a required value, and must reference an existing version as returned by the <OperationLink operation="database-list-redis-versions" /> endpoint.

The response will contain the following properties:

- `id` contains the ID of the created database.

<OperationHint tag="Database" operation="database-create-redis-database" />

## Accessing the database

After creating a database, you can send a request to the <OperationLink operation="database-get-redis-database" /> route.

Among others, the response will contain the following values:

- `hostname` and `port` contain the hostname and port of the database. You can use these values to connect to the database from within your hosting environment.
- `configuration` allows you to inspect the specific configuration values that were applied to your database.

<OperationHint tag="Database" operation="database-get-redis-database" />
