## Overview

The product *mittwald AI Hosting* is aimed at agencies, freelancers, and their end clients. It enables the use of various Large Language Models (LLMs) via an OpenAI-compatible API, allowing integration into custom applications for a wide range of AI use cases.

These use cases include, for example:

-   **Text generation** or the implementation of a **chat bot**
-   **Image processing**, such as generating image descriptions or `alt` texts
-   Building a **RAG system** using our container hosting to create a custom, AI-powered knowledge base
-   **AI agents** that can autonomously handle complex tasks using tool-calling or as MCP servers

On the following subpages, we explain how to obtain an API key, how to use the offered models with it, and we showcase example applications.

### Beta Status

mittwald AI-Models are currently in a beta phase. During this phase, malfunctions may occur. We reserve the right to replace, add, or remove models during the beta period or to adjust functionalities such as the rate limit.

### Feedback

We appreciate feedback on our product. In mStudio, you’ll find an option in the lower right corner of the screen to send us your feedback. We also welcome suggestions regarding features and models.

### Setting Up the API Key

To obtain an API key, you need access to the [mStudio](https://studio.mittwald.de) and a [organization](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/organizations). Both can be created free of charge. At this time, an existing project with an active hosting product is also required.

Within a project in mStudio, you’ll find the "AI-Models" menu item on the left-hand side, which opens the API key management interface. After completing the booking process, you will receive the API base URL and can create an API key to use the models.
