  MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is a popular choice for web applications and is often used in combination with PHP. This guide will help you get started with MySQL on your mittwald space.

## Creating a MySQL database

<Tabs groupId="access-mode">
  <TabItem value="gui" label="mStudio UI">
    To create a MySQL database in the mStudio, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to the project that you want to create the database in.
    2. Select the "Databases" menu item in the sidebar.
    3. Click the "Create Database" button and select "MySQL".
    4. Enter a description for the database, select the desired version and choose a password for the database user.

    After the installation has completed, observe the host and port in the details under connection information. You
    need both for the configuration of your system.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
    To create a MySQL database from the CLI, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    $ mw database mysql create --description "My MySQL database" --version 8.0
    ```

    This command will prompt you to enter a password for the database user. To skip the prompt, use the `--password` option (be careful, because this will store the password in your shell history), or set the `MYSQL_PWD` environment variable, first:

    ```bash
    $ read -s MYSQL_PWD
    $ export MYSQL_PWD
    $ mw database mysql create ...
    ```

    There are additional flags that you can provide to set additional options:

    - `--character-set` and `--collation` to set the [character set and collation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-mysql.html) for the database. These default to `utf8mb4` and `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, respectively. Usually, there is little reason to change these, except when migrating from an existing database.
    - `--user-access-level` allows you to restrict the permissions of the database user. The default is `full`, which grants all permissions. You can also choose `readonly`.
    - `--user-external` allows you to create a user that can connect from outside the mittwald cloud platform. This is disabled by default.

    After the installation has completed, use the `mw database mysql get` command to observe the connection information.

## Operational concerns

### Managed backup and recovery

The mittwald cloud platform automatically creates backups of your projects and their databases at regular intervals. You can inspect the available backups as any time using the mStudio UI or the [`mw` CLI][cli], using the `mw backup list` command. You can also create a backup manually using the `mw backup create` command:

```shellsession title="Local shell session"
$ mw backup create --wait --expires 30d
```

To recover the contents of a single MySQL database, you can follow the following steps:

1. Download a backup to your local machine:

   ```shellsession title="Local shell session"
   $ mw backup download <backup-id> --format tar --output backup.tar.gz
   ```

2. After downloading the backup, you can extract the database contents from the downloaded archive:

   ```shellsession title="Local shell session"
   $ database_id=<database-id>
   $ tar xfz backup.tar.gz dbdump-${database_id/_/-}
   ```

   :::note Note that in the archive files, the database ID is spelled differently. Whereas it usually follows the format `mysql_XXXXXX`, in the archive, it is spelled with dashes instead of underscores, like `mysql-XXXXXX`. :::

3. Recover the backup using the `mw database mysql import` command. For this, you need to have an SSH key set up on your local machine, which is also linked to your mStudio user account.

   ```shellsession title="Local shell session"
   $ database_id=<database-id>
   $ mw database mysql import ${database_id} --input dbdump-${database_id/_/-}/*.sql.gz --gzip
   ```

### Manual backup and recovery

You can use the [`mw` CLI][cli] to manually create (and restore) backups of your MySQL database. As a prerequisite, you need to have an SSH key set up on your local machine, which is also linked to your mStudio user account.

To create a backup, run the following command:

```shellsession title="Local shell session"
$ mw database mysql dump <database-id> --output dump.sql.gz --gzip
```

In this command, replace `<database-id>` with the ID of the MySQL database you want to back up. The `--gzip` flag compresses the backup file, which can save disk space and reduce transfer times.

:::tip

If you want to create the backup with a different user than the one you are currently logged in with, you can use the `--ssh-user` flag to specify a different user for the SSH connection. However, you still need to make sure that an SSH key is set up on your local machine for that user.

:::

To restore a backup, run the following command:

```shellsession title="Local shell session"
$ mw database mysql import <database-id> --input dump.sql.gz --gzip
```
