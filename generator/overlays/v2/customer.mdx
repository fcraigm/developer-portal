# Organizations/Customers

The customer API allows you to manage your own organizations and users.

:::important Important to know: "customers" vs. "organizations"

Please note the naming discrepancy between the API and the UI; the UI refers to **"organizations"**, which are referred to as **"customers"** in the API. These are **not** two different kinds of resources; they are the same thing, just differently named.

<OperationDocCardList apiVersion="v2" tag="Customer" />
