### mittwald PHP SDK Release v2.1.108

The latest release of the mittwald PHP SDK, version v2.1.108, introduces significant changes to the API client structure. Notably, this release removes the `Scaling` and `ServerInternal` classes. The `Scaling` class, which managed scaling parameters such as `maximum` and `minimum` limits, has been eliminated. Similarly, the `ServerInternal` class, which included properties and functions related to the internal server object model, has also been removed. These changes suggest a shift towards a potentially simpler or different model for managing server and scaling details.
