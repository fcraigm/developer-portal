title: How to Manage Your OAuth2 Clients
---

To allow users of your product (in the mittwald marketplace) to authenticate via mittwald, you can create OAuth2 clients.
OAuth2 clients can be managed through the mStudio API once you are a contributor.

To create an OAuth2 client, you can use the <OperationLink operation="contributor-create-oauth-client" /> operation.
To edit a client, use the <OperationLink operation="contributor-patch-oauth-client" /> operation.

For more information about the required parameters, see the [OAuth2 Reference](../../reference/oauth2).

## What Can I Use an OAuth2 Client For?

You can use an OAuth2 client to enable your extension to be accessed without the mStudio frontend.
This is especially useful when the purpose of your extension is to integrate with another existing Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product â€”
in other words, when the primary use takes place outside of mStudio.

It is also possible to use mittwald as an authentication provider without developing an extension for mStudio.
In that case, you also need an OAuth2 client.
