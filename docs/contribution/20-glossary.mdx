## Contributor

Selected organizations can provide Extensions of the mStudio to its users as a `Contributor`.

## Extension

An `Extension` is an Extension of the mStudio, that is provided by the contributor.
It offers ways to interact with the public mittwald API.
These interactions are authenticated and authorized.

## Extension Context

Extensions can be added to either a project or an organization.
We generalize this with the term `Extension Context`.
As a contributor, you decide which Extension context should be used for your Extension.

## Extension Instance

When you add an Extension to an Extension context, an `Extension Instance` is created.
For example, if you add an Extension to a project, an Extension Instance is created for this project.
If the same Extension is added to another project, a new Extension Instance is created for the second project.
This is important since every Extension Instance has its unique ID, configuration, consented scopes, etc.

## Scope

A `Scope` is a set of permissions, an Extension can request.
If an Extension is added to an Extension context, the user has to consent to the requested scopes.

## Domain Action

`Domain Action` is a general term for any request sent to the public mittwald API,
such as the creation of a new project or the invitation of a user to an organization.
