## What is an extension?

From a domain perspective, an extension is an extension of the mStudio that provides additional functionality for the mStudio.
It is made available in the mStudio and can be added to an [extension context](../../glossary/#extension-context) by potential users.
When added to an extension context, an [extension instance](../../glossary#extension-instance) is created.
Therefore, the extension describes an extension that can be added to an extension context.
The extension instance is a concrete manifestation of an extension in an extension context.

From a technical perspective, an extension is an application operated separately from the mStudio and integrated with the mStudio via REST-APIs.
An extension must provide a public backend and may provide a frontend if it makes sense for its usage.
The backend of an extension handles [lifecycle webhooks](../concepts/lifecycle-webhooks).
These webhooks are used by the mStudio to inform the extension about the state of its extension instances.
The extensions also provide various [athentication and authorization strategies](../concepts/authentication) to perform authenticated [domain actions](../../glossary#domain-action) in the mStudio.
These domain actions can occur in the name of the mStudio user using the extension or in the name of the extension itself.

## Which information does an extension consist of?

An extension consists of various pieces of information described in detail in the [extension reference](../../reference/extensions).
The following is an overview.

### Name and Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
Eine Extension enthält drei verschiedene Beschreibungsfelder.

Der **Name** und eine **Kurzbeschreibung** sind das erste, das ein Nutzer in der Extension-Übersicht im Marktplatz sieht.
Daneben gibt es eine **ausführliche Beschreibung**, die mehr Details zur Extension enthält und Formatierung anbietet.
In dieser kann auf Features, Nutzungshinweise, weiterführende Links, einen Changelog und vieles mehr eingegangen werden.

### State

Der **State** der Extension definiert, ob sie im mStudio sicht- und nutzbar sein soll.
Das umfasst beispielsweise (jeweils unabhängig voneinander), ob sie generell aktiv ist, im Marktplatz angezeigt wird und ob sie zu einem Extension Context hinzugefügt werden kann.
=======
An extension has 3 levels of description.
The first things a user sees of the extension in the marketplace are the name and the short description.
Additionally, there is a long description containing more details for the extension and allows for formatting.
Here, you can include descriptions of features, instructions for use, links for further reading, a changelog, and much more.

### State

To manage whether an extension is available in the mStudio you can configure its state.
You can configure the extension's visibility and installability.

### Tags

Tags provide a way to categorize extensions.
The mStudio uses them to group extensions based on their use case.
You should ensure the tags are meaningful and allow an unambiguous mapping to the extension features.
You also should ensure the tags match terms potential users might use to search for the extension.
A category with only one extension does not provide value when searching for extensions.
It reduces the ability to find and compare extensions.

### Support

The contributor is responsible for the support of the use of its extensions.
Therefore, the extension users need information about how to request support.
You have to provide at least an E-Mail address where users can contact you.

### Scopes

<<<<<<< HEAD
Um über die REST-API des mStudios zugreifen, und dort **Domain Actions** durchführen zu können, benötigt eine Extension Berechtigungen, die vom Nutzer während der Installation bestätigt werden müssen.

Diese Berechtigungen sind in Form von [**Scopes**](../concepts/scopes) definiert. Die Extension-Definition enthält eine Liste von Scopes, die die Berechtigungen der Extension beschreiben.
=======
An extension has to request privileges to be able to perform domain actions in the mStudio.
Scopes are defined to define the privileges of an extension.
For further information, see [scopes concept](../concepts/scopes).

### Extension Context

Users can add an extension either to a project or an organization.
As the contributor, you must decide which extension context makes sense for your extension.
This decision depends on multiple factors, such as the target audience, use case, or business model.

### Lifecycle Webhook Endpoints

An extension must define which URLs should be used by the mStudio to send lifecycle webhooks.
The mStudio uses these webhooks to inform the extension about the existence and state of its extension instances.
You can configure a separate webhook endpoint for each lifecycle.
For further information, see [lifecycle webhook concept](../concepts/lifecycle-webhooks).

### External Frontend

Optionally, an extension may define an external frontend that functions as an entry point to the extension.
You configure the external frontend as a URL, for which you may use templating.
For further information, see [templating of configuration values](../concepts/templating) and [lifecycle webhook concept](../concepts/lifecycle-webhooks).

## Versioning of Extensions

The mStudio does not provide a concept for the versioning of extensions.
Extensions are separate applications the corresponding contributor is responsible for, integrated with the mStudio only via the public REST API.
Therefore, mittwald can not reliably manage the versioning and stability of versions of extensions.

The use case of an extension may require providing functionality in different versions.
You can implement this versioning independently of the mStudio.
You are responsible for versioning your extensions and may introduce individual rules and conventions.

If the extension provides an API used by external applications, you should ensure its stability.
To this end, you may use commonplace conventions and best practices for API versioning.
