title: Implementend Anchors for frontend fragments
---

Currently, anchors are being developed for various areas of the mStudio.
Also, a feature is being developed to locate anchors directly in the mStudio and to view which additional properties are provided or required for an anchor.
Until then, you can find the currently available anchors in the following table.

| Fragment Path                                      | Description                        | Useful context parameters |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `/customers/customer/menu/section/extensions/item` | Menu entry in an organization      | `customerId`              |
| `/projects/project/menu/section/extensions/item`   | Menu entry in the project overview | `projectId`               |
| `/projects/project/apps/detail/menu-top/item`      | Tab in an app's detail view        | `projectId`, `appId`      |
