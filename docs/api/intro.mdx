  This page provides an introduction to the mStudio v2 API and its concepts.
---

import OperationLink from "@site/src/components/OperationLink";
import OperationExample from "@site/src/components/OperationExample";

## Base URLs

The mStudio v2 API uses `https://api.mittwald.de/v2/` as base URL for all API endpoints.

## Specification

You can find the full API specification in the [OpenAPI 3.0 format](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0) here:

1. [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://api.mittwald.de/openapi) (machine-readable)
2. [Rendered HTML documentation](../../reference) (human-readable)

## Changelog

Changes to the API are documented in the [changelog](/changelog/tags/apiv2/). Changelog entries are generated automatically at the end of each day. If you wand to be notified about changes to the API, you can subscribe to the [RSS feed](/changelog/rss.xml).

## Authentication

### Obtaining an API token

To authenticate to the API, you will need an **API Token**. You can obtain one either via the mittwald mStudio Web UI or via the API itself (if you already have another API token).

1. **In the UI**, go to your user profile and choose the [API tokens](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/profile/api-tokens) menu item.
2. Alternatively, **via the API**, use the <OperationLink operation="user-create-api-token" /> endpoint. This requires you to already have an existing API token:

   <OperationExample
     operation="user-create-api-token"
     headers={{ Authorization: "Bearer <EXISTING_API_TOKEN>" }}
     example={{
       description: "My API token",
       expiresAt: "2021-12-31T23:59:59+00:00",
       roles: ["api_read", "api_write"],
     }}
   />

   The response will contain a JSON document with a `token` key. This is your API token.

:::caution

Make sure to store your API token in a secure place. It is the only way to authenticate to the API. A lost token cannot be recovered.

### Authenticating requests

Once you have obtained an API token, there are two ways to authenticate to the API:

1. Use the `X-Access-Token` HTTP header. The value of the header is just the API token itself.

   ```http {3}
   GET /v2/user HTTP/1.1
   Host: api.mittwald.de
   X-Access-Token: <API_TOKEN>
   ```

2. Use the `Authorization` HTTP header, providing the API token as a `Bearer` Token.

   ```http {3}
   GET /v2/user HTTP/1.1
   Host: api.mittwald.de
   Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>
   ```

## Rate Limiting

Usage of the API is rate-limited to prevent abuse. You can inspect the rate limiting for your current user by observing the headers included in each response:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests you are allowed to make per period.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current period.
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The remaining time (in seconds) until the current rate limit period ends and a new one begins.

Some special routes may be exempt from rate limiting. These routes will respond with a `X-RateLimit-Exempt` header set to `yes`.

## Eventual Consistency

The read models of our event sourced architecture are [eventually consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency). If you want to learn about this, have a read of the [blog post about event sourcing](https://www.mittwald.de/blog/webentwicklung-design/was-ist-eventsourcing). As a consequence, changes being made by a POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE request may take a moment until all read models are updated. This may cause a (GET) request executed immediately after the mutating request to run into an error, typically with an HTTP status code like `404` or `403`. To handle this eventual consistency, you can use a combination of the response header `etag` and the request header `if-event-reached`.

To prevent the issue, you might use the event id returned in the `etag` header of the mutating request.

```
etag: 276638689419853824
```

This event id might be used as the value for the `if-event-reached` header of the subsequent (GET) request. If this header is set, the processing services will wait until the event is handled. After the event is handled, the service will execute and answer the request.

```
if-event-reached: 276638689419853824
```

Please note, that such a request can fail with `412 Precondition Failed` if the event is not reached within 10 seconds.
