## Schema der OAuth2 Clients

import SchemaWithExample from "../../../src/components/openapi/SchemaWithExample";

As a contributor, you can manage OAuth2 Clients via the mStudio API.
The required routes are described in the [Guide to Managing OAuth2 Clients](../../how-to/manage-oauth-clients).

Below, the required parameters are explained in more detail.

    },

### allowedScopes

The scopes that the client _may_ request.
The client does not have to request all scopes.
If the OAuth2 Client is used for an Extension, the scopes of the OAuth2 Client do not have to be identical to the scopes of the Extension.
In many cases, it makes sense that the scopes differ.

For example, one such case is that an Extension might only do reading and not writing operations without user interaction.
The writing operations are then executed by an mStudio User using the Extension with the help of OAuth2.

### allowedRedirectURIs

The redirect URIs that the client _may_ use.
If the authorization server allows only one redirect URI, the client does not have to specify a `redirect_uri`,
as describen in [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2.3).
However, if the authorization server allows multiple redirect URIs, the client must specify a `redirect_uri` that is identical to one of the allowed URIs.

Templating is not supported for the redirect URIs to avoid common gaps in the OAuth2 implementation.
The mStudio makes a simple string comparison to validate, whether an URI is allowed.
The URI string contains the protocol, the complete domain, the port, and the path of the URI.

It makes sense to allow `http://localhost` as redirect URI to make local testing possible.
You have to ensure that the correct port is configured, as mentioned above.
