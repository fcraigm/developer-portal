:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains breaking changes. Please review the changes carefully.

:::

## Summary

- A `429 Too Many Requests` status code has been added to the specification of _every_ API endpoint. This status code is returned when the rate limit is exceeded. The rate limiting feature is not new, but the documentation has been updated to reflect this behavior. See the section on [API ratelimiting](../../../../../docs/v2/api/intro#rate-limiting) for more information.
- Changed the way the request body of the <OperationLink operation="ingress-update-ingress-tls" apiVersion="v2" /> endpoint is defined (might potentially cause breaking changes in generated client code).

Note that this is not a breaking change when you are using the API directly, but it might cause breaking changes in code generated from the OpenAPI schema.
