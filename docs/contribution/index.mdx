## Introduction to the Contribution Concept

**Extensions are the ideal way to extend the functionality of the mStudio.**

An extension is a web application managed by a contributor and provided to the mStudio users.
An authorized user can then add that extension to an organization or project.

The content, or rather the functionality, of the extension should provide value for the mStudio user with managing, creating, and editing their web projects.
It should achieve this by extending the functionality of the mStudio.

From a technical perspective, an extension is an application separate from and independent of the mStudio and integrates with the mStudio via REST APIs.
An extension has to provide a publicly available backend.
If, for example, instances of the extension are created or deleted, the mStudio notifies the extension via webhooks to its backend.
It may also provide a frontend if that makes sense for the extension's use case.

**Extension can...**

... simplify and speed up the workflow while using the mStudio, improving productivity.

... fetch information, create or edit resources, or to automate workflows.

... interact with the public mStudio API, authenticated and authorized.

... implement automated deployment strategies via third party CI/CD pipelines.

... integrate existing third party products with the mStudio and therefore provide them for thousands of organizations.

... be used to realize alternative business models.

## From Conception to Release

**Develop the Concept**
You have already identified a problem, you wanted to solve for a long time?
Perfect! Then let's go!
Even if you are unsure, reach out to us (by e-mail: contributorwerden@mittwald.de).
We will decide together what you need and how we can support you.

**Become a Contributor**
Write an e-mail to contributorwerden@mittwald.de.
Let's clarify questions and discuss the next steps.
Afterward, we will list you as a contributor and you can start.

**Develop an Extension**
Let's go!
In this documentation, you will find hints, tools, templates, examples, etc.

**Contact with Mittwald**
Do you have questions? Do you require functionality? We support you!
You get access to [the private GitHub repository](https://github.com/mittwald/contributor-support), where you can exchange information with us and all other contributors.
We will also gladly connect you to our technical experts so that you stay in the flow.

**Release an Extension**
Have you completed development? Then release your extension!
We only require [a YAML file](reference/extensions) from you.
We then validate the content of your extension once.
Afterward, we take the extension live in the mStudio and thousands of customers can add it.

**Earn Money**
You decide whether your extension should cost monthly and how much.
You get 85% of the revenue.
mittwald keeps 15% as comission.
We also completely take care of the billing.
We create the bills for customers and take care of your payment.

**Support Customers**
If a customer has questions regarding your extension, they will contact you directly.
Currently, this communication is organized via e-mail.
In the future, we want to provide a support system.

**Continued Development**
Develop your extension in the direction and speed, you prefer.

**Be Happy**
A problem you wanted to solve for a long time is solved!
You help other agencies that have the same problem and also earn money!
What are you waiting for?

## Structure of this documentation

This documentation will guide you while learning about the fundamental concepts of extension development.
Combined with your development experience and your idea for an extension, this documentation should enable you to develop your extension and release it for mStudio users.

This documentation also describes fundamental organizational processes in addition to technical content.
You will find information about the platform where mittwald and contributors exchange information, the support path for the users of your extension, and the billing of your extension.

In the [Glossary](glossary), you find definitions of various terms.

The section [Overview](../category/overview) conveys fundamental knowledge about extensions.

The section [How-To](../category/how-to) answers frequently asked questions.

The section [Reference](../category/reference) describes technical concepts in depth.
It includes documentation of schemas, templates, tips for development, and explanations.

The opportunity for external contributors to develop extensions is new for mittwald.
We are actively working on this concept, and this documentation is therefore updated regularly.
If you miss something in the documentation, please use the button in the top right corner to contact us via GitHub.
We are grateful for any feedback!
