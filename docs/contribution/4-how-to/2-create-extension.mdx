# Submitting an Extension

To register an extension in the mStudio for you, we just need a YAML file from you.
You can submit it to us via an issue in [this private GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mittwald/contributor-support).

We will take a look at the content of your extension and then unlock it for all mStudio users.
For the structure and content of the file, see the [extension reference](../../reference/extensions).

# Submitting an OAuth2 Client

If you want to use an OAuth2 client for your extension, we just need a YAML file from you.
You can submit it to us via an issue in [this private GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mittwald/contributor-support).
For the structure and content of the file, see the [OAuth2 reference](../../reference/oauth2).

# Editing an Extension

You have full control over the code of your extension and may change it as much as you like to.
If you want to edit the master data of your extension, please submit the updated YAML file via an issue in [this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mittwald/contributor-support)
including a short description of what changed.
We will process the edits as fast as possible.
