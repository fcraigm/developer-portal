title: Implementend Anchors for frontend fragments
---

Currently, anchors are being developed for various areas of the mStudio.
Also, a feature is being developed to locate anchors directly in the mStudio and to view which additional properties are provided or required for an anchor.
Until then, you can find the currently available anchors in the following table.
The table contains the identifier of the anchor as well as some contextual parameters you could retrieve using the Ext Bridge.

| Fragment Path                                      | Description                        | Useful context parameters |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `/customers/customer/menu/section/extensions/item` | Menu entry in an organization      | `customerId`              |
| `/projects/project/menu/section/extensions/item`   | Menu entry in the project overview | `projectId`               |
| `/projects/project/apps/detail/menu-top/item`      | Tab in an app's detail view        | `projectId`, `appId`      |

Each anchor may need additional properties to be definded, while configuring the frontend fragment. Currently, the following properties are required for each anchor:

- **icon**: SVG icon for the menu entry.
- **title**: Title of the menu entry. This is a JSON object with the language code as key and the title as value.
  For example: `{"de": "Meine Extension"}`. Currently, only the language code "de" is supported.

Example:

```json
{
  "/projects/project/menu/section/extensions/item": {
    "url": "https://my-extension.com/project/:projectId",
    "additionalProperties": {
      "icon": "<svg>...</svg>",
      "title": "{\"de\": \"Meine Extension\"}"
    }
  }
}
```
