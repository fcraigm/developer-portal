## Starting a Node.js application

<Tabs groupId="access-mode">
  <TabItem value="gui" label="mStudio UI">
    To start a Node.js application from the mStudio, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to the project that you want to create the application in.
    2. Select the "Apps" menu item in the sidebar.
    3. Click the "Create App" button and select "Custom Node.js app".
    4. In the installation wizard, select the entrypoint command that should be used to start your application and complete the wizard.

    After the installation has completed, observe the installation directory in the UI.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
    To start a Node.js application from the CLI, run the following command:

    ```bash
    $ mw app create node --wait --entrypoint "npm start"
    ```

    The `--wait` flag will cause the CLI to wait until the installation has completed. The `--entrypoint` flag will cause the CLI to configure the specified entrypoint command as the command that should be used to start your application. If omitted, the default entrypoint command `yarn start` will be used.

    After the installation has completed, use the `mw app get` command to observe the installation directory.

## Deploying your app

After you have created your Node.js app, you can deploy your code by moving it into the designated application directory. You may use any method that you prefer to deploy your code, such as a local Git clone, rsync or SFTP.

Have a look at our collection of [deployment guides](/docs/v2/category/deployment-guides) for more information on how to deploy your code.

:::info

Since the deployment of your application is optimized for production usage, the platform will **NOT** automatically restart your application on code changes. You will need to restart your application manually after you have deployed your code. See the section on [managing your process lifecycle](#managing-your-process-lifecycle) for more information.

:::

## Making your app accessible via HTTP

After you have created your Node.js app, you can make it accessible via HTTP. Our platform will make sure that the process that you have configured in the previous step will be running at all times.

:::info

There is a possibility that your application will not immediately start when you have created your application _before_ deploying any code. In this case, our automation will attempt to start your process for a certain number of times and then back off. When connected to a shell in your hosting environment, you can use the `mittnitectl job status` command to inspect your process status, and then `mittnitectl job start` to start your process. See the section on [managing your process lifecycle](#managing-your-process-lifecycle) for more information.

:::

You can connect your application to the internet by linking it to a domain via the mStudio or the API. Our platform will take care of routing any traffic to that domain to your application, and will also handle TLS termination, if you have configured a certificate.

Your Node.js application simply needs to listen for plain HTTP traffic on a port that should be read from the `PORT` environment variable.

:::caution

Please **DO NOT** make any assumptions about the port that your application should listen on. The port that your application should listen on is provided via the `PORT` environment variable, and may change at any time.

:::

## Managing your process lifecycle

With a Node.js application, the entire lifecycle of your process is managed within the application itself. Within your hosting environment, your Node.js process is managed by the [mittnite init system](https://github.com/mittwald/mittnite), a lightweight process manager that is responsible for starting, stopping and restarting your application.

Within your hosting environment, you can use the `mittnitectl` command to manage your application:

- `mittnitectl job start` starts your application
- `mittnitectl job stop` stops your application
- `mittnitectl job restart` restarts your application

You can also use `mittnitectl` to view the status of your application:

- `mittnitectl job status` shows the status of your application
- `mittnitectl job logs` shows the logs of your application

## Using Yarn Plug'n'Play

If your project uses the [Yarn PnP](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) installation mode, it is recommended to disable the [global cache](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#enableGlobalCache).

```yml title=".yarnrc"
enableGlobalCache: false
```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are generally used to configure Node.js applications. Depending on the Node.js version, we recommend different variants to define these.

<Tabs groupId="environment-variables">
  <TabItem value="below-20-6" label="< Node.js 20.6">
    You can define environment variables in the following files. They are then automatically available in your application:

    - `/files/.mwsoftware/node/.env`
    - `/home/p-xxxxxx/.config/node/.env`

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="from-20-6" label=">= Node.js 20.6">
    As of Node.js 20.6, an (experimental) flag `--env-fileconfig` is available (see [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v20.x/docs/api/cli.html#--env-fileconfig)). This can be specified as often as required to load .env files whose environment variables are then available in the app.

    To use the flag, configure the start command of your Node.js app as follows, for example:

    ```bash
    node --env-fileconfig=.env server.js
    ```

    The path to the `.env` file is specified relative to the working directory.

    If you use an npm or yarn script to start your application, the following example applies:

    ```json title="package.json"
    {
      [..]
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node --env-fileconfig=.env server.js"
      }
      [..]
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
