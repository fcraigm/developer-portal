### Obtaining the default stack

Every mStudio project comes with a default stack named `default`. You can obtain the default stack by using the <OperationLink operation="container-list-stack" apiVersion="v2-preview" /> operation.

### Creating new stacks

Creating new stacks is not supported at this time. You can only manage the `default` stack.
