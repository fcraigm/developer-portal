:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

## Summary


- The response property type for `appId` has changed from 'string' to 'uuid' for status '200' in the following operations: 
  - `GET /v2/apps/{appId}/versions` (List AppVersions belonging to an App)
  - `GET /v2/apps/{appId}/versions/{appVersionId}` (Get an AppVersion)
  - `GET /v2/apps/{appId}/versions/{baseAppVersionId}/update-candidates` (List update candidates belonging to an AppVersion). This is a breaking change.
