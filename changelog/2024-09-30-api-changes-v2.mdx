:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

## Summary


- The request properties 'email' and 'password' have both become required for the `POST` operation `user-authenticate-mfa` at the path `/v2/authenticate-mfa`. This is a breaking change.
- The minimum value for the 'query' request parameter 'page' has been decreased from '1.00' to '0.00' for the `GET` operation `app-list-appinstallations` at the path `/v2/projects/{projectId}/app-installations`.
- The response property '/allOf[subschema #2]/name' has become required for the status '202' in both the `DELETE` operation `user-delete-user` at the path `/v2/users/self` and the `PUT` operation `user-change-password` at the path `/v2/users/self/credentials/password`.
