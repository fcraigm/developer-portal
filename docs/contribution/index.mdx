## Structure of this documentation

This documentation will guide you while learning about the fundamental concepts of extension development.
Combined with your development experience and your idea for an extension, this documentation should enable you to develop your extension and release it for mStudio users.

This documentation also describes fundamental organizational processes in addition to technical content.
You will find information about the platform where mittwald and contributors exchange information, the support path for the users of your extension, and the billing of your extension.

In the [Glossary](glossary), you find definitions of various terms.

The section [Overview](../category/overview) conveys fundamental knowledge about extensions.

The section [How-To](../category/how-to) answers frequently asked questions.

The section [Reference](../category/reference) describes technical concepts in depth.
It includes documentation of schemas, templates, tips for development, and explanations.

The opportunity for external contributors to develop extensions is new for mittwald.
We are actively working on this concept, and this documentation is therefore updated regularly.
If you miss something in the documentation, please use the button in the top right corner to contact us via GitHub.
We are grateful for any feedback!
