## What is an extension?

From a domain perspective, an extension is an extension of the mStudio that provides additional functionality for the mStudio.
It is [made available](../../how-to/create-extension) in the mStudio and can be added to an [extension context](../../glossary/#extension-context) by potential users.
When a user adds an extension to an extension context (for example, a project or organization), the mStudio creates an [extension instance](../../glossary#extension-instance).
Therefore, the extension describes an extension that can be added to an extension context.
The extension instance is a concrete manifestation of an extension in an extension context.

From a technical perspective, an extension is a separate and independent application that communicates with the mStudio via REST APIs.
An extension must provide a public backend and may provide a frontend if it makes sense for its usage.
If extension instances are created or deleted, for example, the mStudio notifies the extension backend via a [lifecycle webhook](../concepts/lifecycle-webhooks).

The extensions also provide various [athentication and authorization strategies](../concepts/authentication) to perform authenticated [domain actions](../../glossary#domain-action) in the mStudio.
These domain actions can occur in the name of the mStudio user using the extension or in the name of the extension itself.

## Which information does an extension consist of?

An extension consists of various pieces of information described in detail in the [extension reference](../../reference/extensions).
The following is an overview.

### Name and Description

An extension has 3 different describing fields.

The first things a user sees in the extension overview in the marketplace are the **name** and a **short description**.
Additionally, it has a **long description** containing more details for the extension and allows for formatting.
Here, you can include descriptions of features, instructions for use, links for further reading, a changelog, and much more.

### State

The **state** of an extension defines whether the extension should be visible or usable in the mStudio.
This includes, for example, whether it is generally active, displayed in the marketplace, and can be added to an extension context.

### Tags

Tags provide a way to categorize extensions.
The mStudio uses them to group extensions based on their use case.
You should ensure the tags are meaningful and allow an unambiguous mapping to the extension features.
You also should ensure the tags match terms potential users might use to search for the extension.
A category with only one extension does not provide value when searching for extensions.
It reduces the ability to find and compare extensions.

### Support

The contributor is responsible for the support of the use of its extensions.
Therefore, the extension users need information about how to request support.
You have to provide at least an E-Mail address where users can contact you.

### Scopes

An extension needs privileges to access the REST API of the mStudio and execute **domain actions**.
These have to be accepted by the user when installing the extension.

These privileges are defined by [**scopes**](../concepts/scopes).
The extension definition contains a list of scopes describing the extensions permissions.

### Extension Context

Users can add an extension either to a project or an organization.
As the contributor, you must decide which extension context makes sense for your extension.
This decision depends on multiple factors, such as the target audience, use case, or business model.

### Lifecycle Webhook Endpoints

An extension must define which URLs should be used by the mStudio to send lifecycle webhooks.
The mStudio uses these webhooks to notify the extension of the existence and state of its extension instances.
You can configure a separate webhook endpoint for each lifecycle event.
For more information, see [lifecycle webhook concept](../concepts/lifecycle-webhooks).

### External Frontend

Optionally, an extension may define an external frontend that functions as an entry point to the extension.
You configure the external frontend as a URL, for which you may use templating.
For more information, see [templating of configuration values](../concepts/templating) and [lifecycle webhook concept](../concepts/lifecycle-webhooks).

## Versioning of Extensions

The mStudio does not provide a concept for the versioning of extensions.
Extensions are separate applications the corresponding contributor is responsible for, integrated with the mStudio only via the public REST API.
Therefore, mittwald can not reliably manage the versioning and stability of versions of extensions.

The use case of an extension may require providing functionality in different versions.
You can implement this versioning independently of the mStudio.
You are responsible for versioning your extensions and may introduce individual rules and conventions.

If the extension provides an API used by external applications, you should ensure its stability.
To this end, you may use commonplace conventions and best practices for API versioning.
