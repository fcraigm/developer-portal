:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

:::



## Summary


- The API path for the `POST` operation `extension-generate-session-key` at `/v2/extension-instances/{extensionInstanceId}/session/{sessionId}` has been removed without deprecation. This is a breaking change.
- The API path for the `GET` operation `extension-get-public-key` at `/v2/webhook-public-keys/{serial}` has been removed without deprecation. This is a breaking change.
- A new `POST` endpoint `extension-authenticate-with-session-token` has been added at `/v2/authenticate-session-token`, allowing authentication of external applications using the extensionInstanceSecret.
- A new `DELETE` endpoint `extension-delete-extension` has been added at `/v2/contributors/{contributorId}/extensions/{extensionId}`, enabling the deletion of an extension.
- A new `POST` endpoint `extension-generate-session-token` has been added at `/v2/extension-instances/{extensionInstanceId}/sessions/{sessionId}`, which generates a session token for transmission to the extensions frontend fragment.
- A new `GET` endpoint `extension-get-public-key` has been added at `/v2/public-keys/{serial}`, allowing retrieval of the public key to verify the webhook signature.
