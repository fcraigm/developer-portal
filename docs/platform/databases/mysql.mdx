## Creating a MySQL database

<Tabs groupId="access-mode">
  <TabItem value="gui" label="mStudio UI">
    To create a MySQL database in the mStudio, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to the project that you want to create the database in.
    2. Select the "Databases" menu item in the sidebar.
    3. Click the "Create Database" button and select "MySQL".
    4. Enter a description for the database, select the desired version and choose a password for the database user.

    After the installation has completed, observe the host and port in the details under connection information. You
    need both for the configuration of your system.

  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
    To create a MySQL database from the CLI, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    $ mw database mysql create --description "My MySQL database" --version 8.0
    ```

    This command will prompt you to enter a password for the database user. To skip the prompt, use the `--password` option (be careful, because this will store the password in your shell history), or set the `MYSQL_PWD` environment variable, first:

    ```bash
    $ read -s MYSQL_PWD
    $ export MYSQL_PWD
    $ mw database mysql create ...
    ```

    There are additional flags that you can provide to set additional options:

    - `--character-set` and `--collation` to set the [character set and collation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-mysql.html) for the database. These default to `utf8mb4` and `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, respectively. Usually, there is little reason to change these, except when migrating from an existing database.
    - `--user-access-level` allows you to restrict the permissions of the database user. The default is `full`, which grants all permissions. You can also choose `readonly`.
    - `--user-external` allows you to create a user that can connect from outside the mittwald cloud platform. This is disabled by default.

    After the installation has completed, use the `mw database mysql get` command to observe the connection information.
