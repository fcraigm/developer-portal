## Prerequisites

To start a custom Docker container, you will need to have the following:

- The project ID of an existing project ([how to create a project](../create-project)), in which the container hosting feature is available
- A container image that you want to start. This image may be available in any public or private registry; however, the registry must be reachable from the internet and not hidden behind a firewall.

## Defining a private registry (optional)

If your container image should be loaded from a private registry, you first need to use the <OperationLink operation="container-create-registry" /> operation to define this new registry:

<OperationExample
  operation="container-create-registry"
  example={{
    credentials: {
      password: "password",
      username: "username",
    },
    description: "My registry",
    uri: "my-registry.example",
  }}
/>

## Starting a container in the default stack

### Identify the default stack

Before starting a container in the default stack, you need to determine the ID of the default stack. For this, list the available stacks in your project by calling the <OperationLink operation="container-list-stacks" /> endpoint. The default stack will we named `default`.

### Defining the container stack

When you have identified the default stack, you can define the container stack that you want to start. The following example shows an example request that starts a container with a volume:

<OperationExample
  operation="container-declare-stack"
  example={{
    services: {
      mycontainer: {
        image: "my-registry/my-container:v1.0.1",
        volumes: ["myvolume:/var/www"],
        command: ["command"],
        entrypoint: ["/entrypoint.sh"],
        environment: {
          FOO: "bar",
        },
      },
    },
    volumes: {
      myvolume: {},
    },
  }}
/>

:::important

The <OperationLink operation="container-declare-stack" /> operation is **idempotent** and will replace the existing stack definition with the new one. This means that any services or volumes that are not included in the new stack definition will be removed from the stack. If you want to add a new service or volume to an existing stack, you need to include all existing services and volumes in the new stack definition. Alternatively, you can use the <OperationLink operation="container-update-stack" /> operation to selectively update individual services or volumes.

:::

See the documentation on [container workloads](/docs/v2/platform/workloads/containers/) for more information on how containers, volumes and networks are defined.

## Starting a new container stack (planned)

Starting new container stacks next to the default stack is not supported at the moment.
