title: How to Set Up a Staging Environment

import OperationLink from "@site/src/components/OperationLink";

Extensions do not support multiple environments.
You have to create a second extension if you want to set up separate environments for test and development purposes.

For example, you can register an extension `My Extension` and the extension `My Extension - Staging`.
You should configure the second extension as `hidden`.
For more information, see [extension reference](../../reference/extensions).
This way, the mStudio won't display the second extension.
However, you can still add the extension to a context via the API.
To add an extension to a context, you can use the operation <OperationLink operation="extension-create-extension-instance" />.

If you add the hidden extension to a context, the mStudio will display the installed extension in the corresponding context.
