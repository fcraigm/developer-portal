## Introduction to the Contribution Concept

**Extensions are the ideal way to extend the functionality of the mStudio.**

An extension is a web application managed by a contributor and provided to the mStudio users.
An authorized user can then add that extension to an organization or project.

The content, or rather the functionality, of the extension should provide value for the mStudio user with managing, creating, and editing their web projects.
It should achieve this by extending the functionality of the mStudio.

From a technical perspective, an extension is an application separate from and independent of the mStudio and integrates with the mStudio via REST APIs.
An extension has to provide a publicly reachable backend.
If, for example, instances of the extension are created or deleted, the mStudio notifies the extension via webhooks to its backend.
It may also provide a frontend if that makes sense for the extension's use case.

**Extension can...**

... simplify and speed up the workflow while using the mStudio, improving productivity.

... fetch information, create or edit resources, or automate workflows.

... interact with the public mStudio API, authenticated and authorized.

... implement automated deployment strategies via third party CI/CD pipelines.

... integrate existing third party products with the mStudio and therefore provide them for thousands of organizations.

... be used to realize alternative business models.

## Requirements for Contributions

You need the following to contribute to the mStudio in the form of an extension:

- An mStudio user and an mStudio organization, which the mStudio displays as the authors of the extension.
  The section [Creating an Organization in the mStudio](./how-to/become-contributor#creating-an-organization-in-the-mstudio) explains how to create both.
- A contributor listing by mittwald.
  You can read how this works in the section [Listing as a Contributor](./how-to/become-contributor#listing-as-a-contributor).
- A support e-mail address, your customers can reach you at.

## Structure of this Documentation

This documentation will guide you while learning about the fundamental concepts of extension development.
Combined with your development experience and your idea for an extension, this documentation should enable you to develop your extension and release it for mStudio users.

This documentation also describes fundamental organizational processes in addition to technical content.
You will find information about the platform where mittwald and contributors exchange information, the support path for the users of your extension, and the billing of your extension.

In the [Glossary](glossary), you find definitions of various terms.

The section [Overview](../category/overview) conveys fundamental knowledge about extensions.

The section [How-To](../category/how-to) answers frequently asked questions.

The section [Reference](../category/reference) describes technical concepts in depth.
It includes documentation of schemas, templates, tips for development, and explanations.

The opportunity for external contributors to develop extensions is new for mittwald.
We are actively working on this concept, and this documentation is therefore updated regularly.
If you miss something in the documentation, please use the button in the top right corner to contact us via GitHub.
We are grateful for any feedback!
