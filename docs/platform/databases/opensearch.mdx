## What is OpenSearch?

OpenSearch is a community-driven, open-source search engine forked from Elasticsearch. It is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As a fork of Elasticsearch, OpenSearch is fully compatible with Elasticsearch APIs and plugins.

## Creating an OpenSearch database

You can provision an OpenSearch database in your mittwald hosting environment using [containers](../../workloads/containers). The most convenient way to do this is using [Terraform](../../deployment/terraform) using our [OpenSearch module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/mittwald/opensearch/mittwald/latest). The following example shows how you can use this module in your own Terraform deployment:

```hcl
resource "random_password" "opensearch_admin" {
  length  = 16
  special = true
}

module "opensearch" {
  source = "mittwald/opensearch/mittwald"

  project_id = "<project-id>"
  initial_admin_password = random_password.opensearch_admin.result
}

output "opensearch_url" {
  value = module.opensearch.url
}
```

After this, you can access your OpenSearch backend using the URL returned by the module. Usually, the URL should be `https://opensearch:9200`. The default username is `admin`, and the password is the one generated by the `random_password` resource.
