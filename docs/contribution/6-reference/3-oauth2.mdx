## Schema der OAuth2 Clients

import SchemaWithExample from "../../../src/components/openapi/SchemaWithExample";

Currently, we define OAuth2 clients with static YAML documents.
The following schema describes the allowed and the required values.

<SchemaWithExample
  withRawJSONSchema
  format="yaml"
  schema={{
    type: "object",
    required: [
      "id",
      "humanReadableName",
      "allowedGrantTypes",
      "allowedScopes",
      "allowedRedirectURIs",
    ],
    properties: {
      id: {
        type: "string",
        format: "uuid",
        description:
          "The ID of the OAuth2 client. It has to be unique and identical to the extension ID",
      },
      humanReadableName: {
        type: "string",
        description:
          "Name of the OAuth2 client. It should be identical to the extension name",
      },
      allowedGrantTypes: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "string",
          enum: ["authorization_code"],
        },
        description:
          "Allowed OAuth2 grant types. Currently, only authorization_code (with PKCE flow) is allowed",
      },
      allowedScopes: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "string",
        },
        description: "Allowed scopes, the client can request.",
        example: ["mail:read", "mail:write", "project:read"],
      },
      allowedRedirectURIs: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "string",
          format: "uri",
        },
        description: "Allowed redirect URIs, the client is allowed to use.",
        example: [
          "https://example.com/oauth2/callback",
          "http://localhost:3000/oauth2/callback",
        ],
      },
      hashedSecret: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Argon2id hashed secret of the OAuth2 client.",
      },
    },
  }}
/>

### allowedScopes

The scopes that the client _may_ request.
The client does not have to request all scopes.
Additionally, the scopes of the OAuth2 client don't have to be identical to the scopes of the extension.
In many cases, it makes sense that the scopes differ.

For example, one such case is that an extension might only do reading and not writing operations without user interaction.
The writing operations are then executed by an mStudio User using the extension with the help of OAuth2.

### allowedRedirectURIs

The redirect URIs that the client _may_ use.
If the authorization server allows only one redirect URI, the client does not have to specify a `redirect_uri`,
as describen in [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2.3).
However, if the authorization server allows multiple redirect URIs, the client must specify a `redirect_uri` that is identical to one of the allowed URIs.

Templating is not supported for the redirect URIs to avoid common gaps in the OAuth2 implementation.
The mStudio makes a simple string comparison to validate, whether an URI is allowed.
The URI string contains the protocol, the complete domain, the port, and the path of the URI.

It makes sense to allow `http://localhost` as redirect URI to make local testing possible.
You have to ensure that the correct port is configured, as mentioned above.

### hashedSecret

In some rare cases, it might be impossible to use the [PKCE flow](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636).
However, it is possible to create a so-called private client.
For this, you need a client secret.

Keep in mind that client secrets raise security-relevant issues you can avoid by using PKCE.
For example, you should not use the private client to implement the OAuth2 authorization code flow in the browser, a native app, or some other easily accessible environment.
The client's secret is not stored securely in such environments and can be extracted easily by bad actors.

**Therefore, we explicitly recommend using the PKCE flow if possible.**

If you want to use a client secret, you have to hash it with Argon2id beforehand.
For more information, see [Argon2id on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) and [the Argon2id reference](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-13).

If you do not define a client secret, the PKCE flow is used automatically,
