# OpenWebUI

## Introduction

**Open WebUI** is a web frontend that allows for comfortable interaction with an LLM. It offers a ChatGPT-like interface with prompt input and additional configuration options.

#### Requirements

1. mStudio account with a vServer  
2. API token for accessing an LLM (e.g., mittwald llm-hosting)  
3. Configured subdomain for web access (e.g., openwebui.my-domain.com)

### Further Links

- mittwald ai-hosting: *Insert Link*  
- Docker Image: `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main`  
- Open Web UI Documentation: https://docs.openwebui.com/

 :::note  
 This guide assumes that you already have an API token for accessing a model. This token is **absolutely necessary** in order to use the prompt feature. Without it, you're only deploying a web frontend.  
  
 Open WebUI is only a frontend for input; no LLM is included in the container itself.

## How to Start the Container

### Usage in mStudio

Go to your project in mStudio and select **"Create Container"**. A guided dialog will open to help you create the container.

In the first step, enter a description – this is a free-text field used to identify the container. Enter **"openwebui"** here and click **"Next"**.

Next, you will be prompted for the desired image. The required name is `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main`. Enter this value and confirm again with **"Next"**.

#### EntryPoint and Volume

- The **EntryPoint** can remain unchanged → click **"Next"**.  
- In the following step, you can optionally create a **volume** (persistent storage). This is not strictly required for `OpenWebUI`, so you can skip this step → **"Next"**.

#### Environment Variables

In the step **"Add Environment Variables"**, no modifications are necessary. Confirm by clicking **"Next"**. In the final dialog, you will be asked for the **port** – you can leave it as it is. Click **"Create Container"** to finish creating and start the container.

#### Assigning the Domain

Now switch to the **Domains** section and link `openwebui.my-domain.tld` to your container. Select the domain and set the newly created container as the target.

From this point onward, the web frontend will be accessible via the domain. A dialog will then appear for creating the admin login credentials.

#### Configuration in the Web Frontend – Storing the API Key

Once the login credentials are created, you will be logged in as an admin. Click on the user bubble and navigate to the settings to store your API access
