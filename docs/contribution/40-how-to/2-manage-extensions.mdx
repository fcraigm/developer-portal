title: How to manage extensions?

import OperationLink from "@site/src/components/OperationLink";

Extensions can currently only be managed via the mStudio's REST API, after you have [registered as a contributor](../become-contributor).
However, mittwald is currently working on a comprehensive management interface for Extensions inside mStudio.
Please note that the marketplace is still a very new feature, and unlike the rest of the REST API,
we currently cannot guarantee the stability of the API routes related to the marketplace and Extension management.
The paths, as well as request and response formats, are still subject to change.

Below are the most important routes needed to manage an Extension via the API.

## Register Extension

An Extension can be registered using the following REST API operation:

<OperationLink operation="extension-register-extension" />

Only a name is required.
If you need an Extension Instance during development, you also have to set an Extension Context.
This context can be changed later, as long as the Extension has not been verified.

## Edit Extension

After registration, the Extension can be edited using the following operation:

<OperationLink operation="extension-patch-extension" />

There are a few exceptions to note.

The REST operation <OperationLink operation="extension-request-asset-upload" /> is used to request the upload of assets, such as images for the marketplace gallery.
As a response, you'll receive an Asset Reference ID, which you can use to upload the asset using the <OperationLink operation="file-create-file" /> operation.
Assets can be deleted via the <OperationLink operation="extension-remove-asset" /> operation.

Uploading a logo works similarly. The operation <OperationLink operation="extension-request-logo-upload" /> is used to request the upload of the logo.
The logo is then uploaded using the <OperationLink operation="file-create-file" /> operation.

The <OperationLink operation="extension-change-context" /> operation allows changing the Extension Context of an Extension.
This route can only be used before the Extension is verified.
Depending on whether Extension Instances already exist, the change will either take effect immediately or all Extension Instances will be removed first before applying the change.

For developing frontend fragments, a global Extension Secret is required.
To generate one, use the <OperationLink operation="extension-generate-extension-secret" /> operation.
The secret will be returned in the response and can then be used in the Extension, e.g., via environment variables.
If the operation is called again, a new secret will be generated.
The old secret will be deprecated and become invalid in approximately 24 hours.
This time window should be used to replace the secret within the Extension.

## Verify Extension

Once your Extension is fully developed and ready for use,
you can request a verification via our REST API.

This is done using the <OperationLink operation="extension-request-extension-verification" /> operation.

We will review the content of your Extension and either verify it or respond with feedback.

## Publish Extension

Once your Extension has been verified, it can be published.
This is a separate step to ensure you retain control over when the Extension becomes available to all mStudio users.

To publish the Extension, call the <OperationLink operation="extension-set-extension-published-state" /> operation.
