This command can be used to modify the desired state of a container stack.

## Usage

### Obtaining the default stack

Every mStudio project comes with a default stack named `default`. You can obtain the default stack by using the <OperationLink operation="container-list-stack" apiVersion="v2" /> operation.

### Creating new stacks

Creating new stacks is not supported at this time. You can only manage the `default` stack.

## Managing volumes

You have two options for managing storage for your container stacks:

- Explicitly declare volumes, using the `$.volumes` property of this request. Volumes are referenced by name, and can be mounted into the container by referencing them in the `$.services[*].volumes` property in the format `<volume-name>:<mount-path>`.
- Use the project volume; this volume is shared among all managed apps and containers of a project. In order to mount the project volume, specify a file path instead of a volume name when mounting the volume (example `/home/p-XXXXX/html:/var/html`).
