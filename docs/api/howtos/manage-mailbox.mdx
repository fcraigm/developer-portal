## Types of mailboxes

In our API, we differentiate between two types of mailboxes:

- **E-Mail adresses** are used to _send and receive_ emails. They are either associated with a mailbox (that you can connect to using an email client) or with a forwarding address (that forwards all incoming emails to one or more other email addresses).
- **Delivery boxes** are used to _send_ emails. They are used to send emails from a web application or a script.

## Requirements

To manage email accounts, you will need an existing project. You can create a new project using the [Creating a project](../create-project) guide.

## Create a new email account

To create a new email account, send a `POST` request to the `/v2/projects/{projectID}/mailaddresses` endpoint. The request body must contain a JSON object with the following properties:

<SchemaFromSpec apiVersion="v2" path="#/components/schemas/de.mittwald.v1.mail.CreateMailAddress" withExample />

:::caution

Take note of the password you set for the email account. You will not be able to retrieve it later.

:::

<OperationHint tag="Mail" operation="mail-create-mail-address" />

## Create a new forwarding address

A forwarding address is an email address that forwards all incoming emails to one or more other email addresses. To create a new forwarding address, send a `POST` request to the `/v2/projects/{projectID}/mailaddresses` endpoint. The request body must contain a JSON object with the following properties:

<SchemaFromSpec apiVersion="v2" path="#/components/schemas/de.mittwald.v1.mail.CreateForwardAddress" withExample />

## Create a new delivery box

A delivery box is an email address that can be used to send emails from a web application or a script. To create a new delivery box, send a `POST` request to the `/v2/projects/{projectID}/deliveryboxes` endpoint. The request body must contain a JSON object with the following properties:

- `description` (string, required): A description for the delivery box. This description will be displayed in the web interface.
- `password` (string, required): The password for the delivery box. This password will be used to authenticate against the SMTP server.

:::caution

Take note of the password you set for the delivery box. You will not be able to retrieve it later.

:::

<OperationHint tag="Mail" operation="mail-create-deliverybox" />

## Deleting email accounts

To delete an email address or a delivery box, send a `DELETE` request to the `/v2/mailaddresses/{id}` or `/v2/deliveryboxes/{id}` endpoint, respectively. The `id` parameter must contain the ID of the email address or delivery box you want to delete. No request body is needed.
