# Getting started with the CLI

## Installation

See the [installation guide](./install.md) for instructions on how to install the mittwald CLI on your system.

## Authenticating

### API access

To use the CLI, you first need to authenticate your client using an API token. Have a look at the ["Obtaining an API token" section](../../intro#obtaining-an-api-token) of the introduction for details on how to obtain an API token.

:::note

Additional authentication mechanisms (like an OAuth2 flow in which you can use your browser to authenticate) are planned for the future.

:::

Having a token, you can authenticate like this:

```
$ mw login token
Enter your mStudio API token: ********
```

For non-interactive usage (for example in CI/CD pipelines), you can also pass the token via the `MITTWALD_API_TOKEN` environment variable:

```
$ export MITTWALD_API_TOKEN=********
$ mw login status
```

### SSH

A few commands (like `mw [app|project] download`, `mw [app|project] ssh` and some of the subcomands for `mw database`) connect to your actual hosting environment via SSH. For these commands, your local environment needs to be set up with an SSH keypair to authenticate against the remote server without prompting for your password.

1. **If you already have an existing SSH private key**, you can import the public key to your mStudio account with the following command:

```
$ mw user ssh-key import
   ```

2. **To create and import a new SSH keypair**, you can use the following command:

```
$ mw user ssh-key create
   ```

Usually, the key pair should be used automatically by the CLI. To explicitly specify the key pair to use (for example, if you receive a `too many authentication failures` error), you have a few options:

1. All commands that require an SSH connection respect your systems [SSH configuration](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config) (typically in `~/.ssh/config`). You can specify the key to use for a specific host like this:

```txt title="~/.ssh/config"
Host *.project.host
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mstudio-cli
   ```

2. Alternatively, all commands that require an SSH connection accept a `--ssh-identity-file` flag that you can use to specify the key to use:

```
$ mw app download ... --ssh-identity-file="~/.ssh/mstudio-cli"
   ```

3. Instead of the `--ssh-identity-file` flag, you can also set the `MITTWALD_SSH_IDENTITY_FILE` environment variable to specify the key to use:

```
$ export MITTWALD_SSH_IDENTITY_FILE=~/.ssh/mstudio-cli
$ mw app download ...
   ```

You can also set the `MITTWALD_SSH_IDENTITY_FILE` environment variable in your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) to make it available in every shell session:

```
$ echo 'export MITTWALD_SSH_IDENTITY_FILE=~/.ssh/mstudio-cli' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```
