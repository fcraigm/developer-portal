# Submitting an Extension

After you [became a Contributor](../become-contributor) you can the register a new Extension via our REST API.

<OperationLink operation="extension-register-extension" />

Once your Extension is developed and ready for use, you can request a review through our REST API.

<OperationLink operation="extension-request-extension-verification" />

We will review your Extension and verify it.
After verification, you can choose when to publish it for all mStudio users.

<OperationLink operation="extension-set-extension-published-state" />

# Submitting an OAuth2 Client

If you want to use an OAuth2 Client for your Extension, we just need a YAML file from you.
You can submit it to us via an issue in [this private GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mittwald/contributor-support).
For the structure and content of the file, see the [OAuth2 reference](../../reference/oauth2).

# Editing an Extension

You have full control over the code of your Extension and may change it as much as you like to.
When you want to change the configuration of the Extension you can do so via our REST API.

<OperationLink operation="extension-patch-extension" />
