## Starting a PHP application

<Tabs groupId="access-mode">
  <TabItem value="gui" label="mStudio UI">
    To start a PHP application from the mStudio, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to the project that you want to create the application in.
    2. Select the "Apps" menu item in the sidebar.
    3. Click the "Create App" button and select "Custom PHP app".

    After the installation has completed, observe the installation directory in the UI.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
    To start a PHP application from the CLI, run the following command:

    ```bash
    $ mw app create php --wait --document-root /public
    ```

    The `--wait` flag will cause the CLI to wait until the installation has completed. The `--document-root` flag can be used to specify a subdirectory of the installation directory to be used as the document root. If the `--document-root` flag is not specified, the entire installation directory will be used as the document root.

    After the installation has completed, use the `mw app get` command to observe the installation directory.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="terraform" label="Terraform">
    To start a PHP application using Terraform, you can use the following example:

    <TerraformExample />
    <TerraformResourceHint resource="app" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="api" label="API">
    To learn how to deploy a PHP application via the API, read the article ["Starting a PHP application"](../../../api/howtos/create-php).
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Deploying your app

### Deploying your code

After you have created your PHP app, you can deploy your code by moving it into the designated application directory. You may use any method that you prefer to deploy your code, such as a local Git clone, rsync or SFTP.

Have a look at our collection of [deployment guides](/docs/v2/category/guides/deployment/) for more information on how to deploy your code.

### Managing OPCache

PHP comes with a built-in opcode cache called OPCache. OPCache is enabled by default, and will cache the compiled PHP code in memory to improve performance. Depending on your configuration, it may take a while for the cache to be updated when you deploy new code.

To force a refresh of the OPCache (for example, after a deployment), you can use tools like [CacheTool](https://github.com/gordalina/cachetool) to connect to the PHP-FPM socket and clear the cache (refer to CacheTool's installation instructions for more information on how to install it). For example, you can run the following command to clear the PHP OPCache:

```bash
$ php ./cachetool.phar opcache:reset --fcgi=127.0.0.1:9000
```

## Enabling PHP auto-updates

Automatically updating PHP patch-level versions is a [currently open feature request](https://github.com/mittwald/feature-requests/issues/70).

You can build your own solution to automatically update PHP by using the `mw app dependency update` [CLI](/cli) command. This command allows you to specify a version constraint for the PHP dependency of your app, and it will update the app's dependencies accordingly. For example, to keep your app on the latest PHP 8.4 release, you can run the following command (either on-demand, or periodically via a cron job):

```shell-session
$ mw app dependency update <app-id> --set php=~8.4
```

## Customizing your PHP configuration

### For the entire project

To customize your PHP configuration for the entire project, you can make changes to the `~/.config/php/php.ini` file, or add a new `.ini` file to the `~/.config/php/php.d` directory. Changes to these files will be detected automatically, and the PHP-FPM service will be restarted.

### Per directory

To customize your PHP configuration for a specific directory, create a `.user.ini` file in that directory.[^1] This file will be parsed by PHP and will override the default configuration.

:::caution

Take note that PHP will cache the `.user.ini` file for whichever value is set in the `user_ini.cache_ttl` setting (which has a default value of 5 minutes).
