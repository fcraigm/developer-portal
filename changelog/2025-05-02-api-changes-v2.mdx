:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

## Summary


- The `webhookURLs` request property for the `POST /v2/contributors/{contributorId}/extensions` operation has undergone significant changes: a new subschema was added, its type/format changed, and several properties were removed, including `webhookURLs/extensionAddedToContext`, `webhookURLs/extensionInstanceRemovedFromContext`, `webhookURLs/extensionInstanceSecretRotated`, and `webhookURLs/extensionInstanceUpdated`. Note that these changes are breaking.
  
- The response body type/format for the `GET /v2/extensions/{extensionId}` operation has changed, and multiple required properties have been removed, including `assets`, `blocked`, `context`, `contributorId`, `description`, `disabled`, `id`, `logoRefId`, `name`, `published`, `scopes`, `state`, `statistics`, `subTitle`, and `support`. This is a breaking change.

- The `GET /v2/extensions` operation now includes a new enum value `true` for the `/items/published` response property.

- Several optional properties have been removed from the `GET /v2/extensions/{extensionId}` response, including `deprecation`, `detailedDescriptions`, `externalFrontends`, `frontendComponents`, `frontendFragments`, and `pricing`.

- The security scheme type for `de.mittwald.v1.commons.LegacyBearerAuthentication` has changed from `apiKey` to `http`.

- New optional properties have been added to the `GET /v2/contributors` response, including `/items/descriptions` and `/items/imprint`.

- The `GET /v2/contributors/{contributorId}` operation now includes new optional properties: `/anyOf[#/components/schemas/de.mittwald.v1.marketplace.Contributor]/descriptions`, `/anyOf[#/components/schemas/de.mittwald.v1.marketplace.Contributor]/imprint`, and `/anyOf[#/components/schemas/de.mittwald.v1.marketplace.OwnContributor]/imprint`, as well as a required property `/anyOf[#/components/schemas/de.mittwald.v1.marketplace.OwnContributor]/contributorNumber`.

- A new optional request property `webhookUrls` has been added to the `POST /v2/contributors/{contributorId}/extensions` operation.

- The `POST /v2/extension-instances` operation now includes a non-success response with the status `403`.

- The response body for the `GET /v2/extensions/{extensionId}` operation has been updated to include `#/components/schemas/de.mittwald.v1.marketplace.Extension` and `#/components/schemas/de.mittwald.v1.marketplace.UnpublishedExtension` in the `anyOf` list.

- Several required properties have been added to the responses of various backup-related operations, including `requestedAt` for `GET /v2/project-backups/{projectBackupId}`, `GET /v2/projects/{projectId}/backups`, and `POST /v2/projects/{projectId}/backups`.
