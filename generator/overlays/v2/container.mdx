# Containers

The containers API allows you to run and manage custom containers on the platform.

Please note that the documentation for the Containers API is provided as a preview. The API is not yet generally available and may be subject to change.

## First steps

### Configuring your container registry

To run images from a private container registry, you need to configure the registry in the platform. You can do this by creating a new container registry resource in the platform and providing the necessary credentials.

You can use the following API operations to manage container registries:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- <OperationLink operation="container-create-registry" apiVersion="v2-preview" /> to create a new container registry
- <OperationLink operation="container-update-registry" apiVersion="v2-preview" /> to update a container registry
- <OperationLink operation="container-delete-registry" apiVersion="v2-preview" /> to delete a registry

After a container registry is configured for a project, you can simply use it **within that project** by prefixing the image name, just as you would with a `docker run` command.

### Starting and updating container stacks

Containers are run as part of a container stack. A container stack is a collection of containers and volumes that are run together. You can use the following API operations to manage container stacks:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- <OperationLink operation="container-list-stacks" apiVersion="v2-preview" /> to list available stacks (use the `default` stack)
- <OperationLink operation="container-declare-stack" apiVersion="v2-preview" /> to declare the desired state of a container stack; this operation is idempotent and can be used to add/update or remove containers and volumes from a stack

### Connecting domains to containers

To connect a domain to a running container, you can specify the container as target of an ingress resource. Use the following API operation to create an ingress connected to a container:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- <OperationLink operation="ingress-create-ingress" apiVersion="v2" /> to connect a domain to a container

## Operational tasks

To manage a container stack's lifecycle, you can use the following API operations:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- <OperationLink operation="container-stop-service" apiVersion="v2-preview" /> to stop a service in a container stack
- <OperationLink operation="container-start-service" apiVersion="v2-preview" /> to start a service in a container stack
- <OperationLink operation="container-get-service-logs" apiVersion="v2-preview" /> to access the STDOUT stream of a service in a container stack

<OperationDocCardList apiVersion="v2-preview" tag="Container" />
